cardinal rule
=============

 - Developed with [flash pascal](http://flashpascal.sourceforge.net/)

This NES-style video game combines elements of two classic arcade games from
Williams Electronics:
[Joust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joust_%28video_game%29) and
[Defender](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_%28video_game%29).

The environment and objective is similar to defender: you have a wide,
scrolling landscape that wraps around, and you must protect things on the
ground from enemies trying to snatch them away.

Instead of a spaceship with a laser gun fending off aliens, you're a
cardinal fending off vampire bats.

Combat works as in Joust : press the action button to flap your wings. When
you collide with a bat, whoever is higher in the air wins the fight.
